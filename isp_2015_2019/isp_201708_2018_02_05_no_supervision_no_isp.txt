To whom it may concern,

Regarding to the instruction from the Faculty in the general meeting on Friday, 12 October 2018, I hereby submit the request for prolongation due to the lack of supervision during my PhD study. 

The PhD timeline and the missing of supervision is described in details as the following

* 2015-11
	- Begin PhD under supervision of Dave (main) and Tobias (secondary).
	- 1st ISP (Nov-2015 to Sep-2016)

* 2016-06 to 2017-04
	- Dave takes his parental leave

	- Tobias is the only supervisor: Group meeting with Tobias including 5 PhD students and at least 5 more master students in 1 hour 45 minutes meeting a week.

	- LACK of SUPERVISION period: ~ 10 months

	- 2nd ISP (2016-09 to 2017-09)

* 2017-08
	- Dave and Tobias reason that I donâ€™t have enough progress and want to fire me via the upcoming study plan.
	- Request of changing supervisors.

	- COMPLETELY NO SUPERVISION and NO ISP

* 2017-11 to 2018-02-05
	- New supervisor appointed: Joachim (main), Justin (secondary).

	- COMPLETELY NO SUPERVISION and NO ISP

* NO SUPERVISION in 5,5 months.

* 2018-02
	- New supervisor appointed: Justin (secondary), Joachim (main).
	- 3rd ISP (3 months)

In 10 months, from 2016-06 to 2017-04, there had been a lack of supervision due to Dave' parental leave. In addition, in the next 5,5 months, from 2017-08 to 2018-02, there was completely no supervision at all. In total, there had been 15,5 months with the lack of and/or no supervision.

I would like to ask for prolongation, which is possibly equal to the amount of months that  I was not get enough supervision as well as the months that there was not any supervision at all that a PhD student needs.

Best regards,
Phuc.
